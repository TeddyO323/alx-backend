### [0x00-pagination](./0x00-pagination/README.md)

This project is focused on implementing pagination techniques to manage and display large datasets efficiently. Pagination is crucial in applications where presenting all data at once is impractical due to volume. Key concepts covered include:

- **Limit and Offset Pagination**: Using SQL queries to limit the number of results returned and to offset the starting point.
- **Cursor-Based Pagination**: An alternative to limit and offset that can be more efficient, especially with large datasets.
- **Implementing Pagination in APIs**: Techniques to handle pagination in RESTful APIs, ensuring that clients can navigate through data seamlessly.

### [0x01-caching](./0x01-caching/README.md)

This project delves into caching mechanisms to improve data retrieval performance and application speed. Caching is an essential strategy for enhancing the responsiveness of applications by storing copies of frequently accessed data. Key concepts covered include:

- **Cache Replacement Policies**: Understanding and implementing various policies like Least Recently Used (LRU), First In First Out (FIFO), and others.
- **In-Memory Caching**: Using in-memory data stores like Redis to cache data for quick access.
- **Distributed Caching**: Techniques to manage caches in a distributed system to maintain data consistency and availability.
